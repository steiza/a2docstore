Doc Store
=========

This project is meant for any civics-minded organization that needs a simple place to host documents publicly.

On the homepage you can see recently uploaded documents:

There's a search page that will search through the document metadata (but not the document contents):

Clicking on a document will take you to a page with document details and a download link:

And there's a basic password protected management page to clean up details or delete documents if needed:

Document metadata is stored in an on-disk sqlite database and the files themselves are stored on disk.

If you want to run your own version, after you check out the repository you'll need to create a basic `settings.yml` file::

    region: 'My City'
    password: '__make_your_own_management_password__'
    cookie_secret: '__this_can_be_anything_it_is_just_for_the_server__'
    google_analytics_id: '__optional_just_remove_this_line_if_not_needed__'

Note that this project uses HTTP Basic auth - if you host this project without HTTPS the management password will be sent over the network in the clear.
